This is the main execution semantics file for Michelson.  It contains the rewrite rule semantics for the all Michelson instructions, as well as logic for transforming values from their Micheline representations to K internal representations.  It also contains the .tzt file loading and contract initialization logic.

```k
requires "michelson/syntax.md"
requires "michelson/configuration.md"
requires "michelson/internal-syntax.md"
requires "michelson/types.md"

module MICHELSON
  imports MICHELSON-SYNTAX
  imports MICHELSON-CONFIG
  imports MICHELSON-INTERNAL-SYNTAX
  imports DOMAINS
  imports COLLECTIONS
  imports BYTES
```

#Loading Semantics

The internal representation of Michelson sets, lists and maps are simply K sets, lists and maps respectively.

```k
  syntax Data ::= Set | Map | List
```

In principle the way an operation's nonce should be generated by the semantics is not documented in Michelson.  The only true requirement is for different operation producing instruction executions to produce different nonces.  Thus, for the time being we use the simplest possible representation.

```k
  syntax OperationNonce ::= #NextNonce(OperationNonce) [function]
  rule #NextNonce(#Nonce(I)) => #Nonce(I +Int 1)
```

This function transforms a Michelson data element from its Micheline representation to its internal K representation given the data and its real Michelson type.  It performs some basic sanity checks on the data passed (that it is of the correct sort, for example). but otherwise does not attempt to do a real typecheck.

```k
  syntax DataOrSeq ::= Data | DataList | MapEntryList // Can't subsort DataList to Data, as that would form a cycle.
  syntax Data ::= #ConcreteArgToSemantics(DataOrSeq, Type) [function]
```

In the future, we anticipate this function validating that its argument is actually formatted correctly to be a key\_hash, but at this time those formatting requirements do not seem to be documented.  Hence, presently it simply wraps its argument in the appropriate production to retain its typing.

```k
  syntax KeyHash ::= #ParseKeyHash(String) [function]
  rule #ParseKeyHash(S) => #KeyHash(S)
```

A simple hook to return the Unix epoch representation of a timestamp passed to the semantics in an ISO8601 format string.  See time.cpp for its implementation.

```k
  syntax Int ::= #ISO2Epoch(String) [function, hook(TIME.ISO2Epoch)]
```

The semantics accept timestamps in one of two formats:

1. An ISO-8601 string.
2. A unix timestamp

This function determines which of the two a given timestamp input fits into, and calls the appropriate parsing function.

```k
  syntax Timestamp ::= #ParseTimestamp(String) [function]
  rule #ParseTimestamp(S) => #Timestamp(#ISO2Epoch(S)) requires findString(S, "Z", 0) >=Int 0
  rule #ParseTimestamp(S) => #Timestamp(String2Int(S)) requires findString(S, "Z", 0) <Int 0
```

Similar to key\_hashes, these functions will validate their arguments in the future.  For now they simply wrap them.

```k
  syntax Address ::= #ParseAddress(String) [function]
  rule #ParseAddress(S) => #Address(S)

  syntax Key ::= #ParseKey(String) [function]
  rule #ParseKey(S) => #Key(S)

  syntax Signature ::= #ParseSignature(String) [function]
  rule #ParseSignature(S) => #Signature(S)
```

A ChainId is simply a specially tagged MBytes.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(H:MBytes, chain_id _) => #ChainId(H)
```

An int can simply be represented directly as a K int.  Nats get an additional sanity check to avoid negative nats.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(I:Int, int _) => I
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(I:Int, nat _) => I requires I >=Int 0
```

Strings, like ints, represent themselves.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, string _) => S
```

MBytes conversion is done by the function rule.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(B:MBytes, bytes _) => B
```

Mutez is simply a specially tagged int - we also sanity check the int to ensure that it is in bounds.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(I:Int, mutez _) => #Mutez(I) requires #IsLegalMutezValue(I)
```

K's function expansion step has already handled converting Michelsons "True/False" booleans into "true/false" K bools, so we don't need to do anything special with them here.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(B:Bool, bool _) => B
```

We delegate these datatypes validations to their own functions.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, key_hash _) => #ParseKeyHash(S)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(I:Int, timestamp _) => #Timestamp(I)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, timestamp _) => #ParseTimestamp(S)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, address _) => #ParseAddress(S)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, key _) => #ParseKey(S)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, signature _) => #ParseSignature(S)
```

The Unit token represents itself.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Unit, unit _) => Unit
```

We recursively convert the contents of pairs, ors and options, if applicable.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Pair A B, pair _ T1:Type T2:Type) =>
       Pair #ConcreteArgToSemantics(A, T1) #ConcreteArgToSemantics(B, T2)

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Some V, option _ T) => Some #ConcreteArgToSemantics(V, T)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(None, option _:AnnotationList _) => None

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Left V, or _:AnnotationList TL:Type _:Type) => Left #ConcreteArgToSemantics(V, TL)
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Right V, or _:AnnotationList _:Type TR:Type) => Right #ConcreteArgToSemantics(V, TR)
```

We wrap Lambdas appropriately and save their type information.  Note that we do *not* recurse into the Block.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(B:Block, lambda _:AnnotationList T1 T2) => #Lambda(T1, T2, B)
```

Collections are converted one element at a time.  We need to handle the cases of 0 and 1 length lists separately due to parsing ambiguities between a size 1 element list, and another embedded list.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ }, list _ _) => .List
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ D1:Data }, list _ T) => ListItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1, T))
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ D1 ; DL:DataList }, list _ T) => #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1 ; DL, list .AnnotationList T)

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1:Data ; D2:Data, list _ T) =>
       ListItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1, T)) ListItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D2, T))

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1:Data ; D2:Data ; DL:DataList, list _ T) =>
       ListItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1, T)) {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D2 ; DL, list .AnnotationList T)}:>List
```

Sets are handled essentially the same way as lists, with the same caveat about needing to handle 3 cases (0-Size sets, 1-Size sets, and otherwise).

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ }, set _ _) => .Set
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ D:Data }, set _ T) => SetItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D, T))
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ D1 ; DL:DataList }, set _ T) => #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1 ; DL, set .AnnotationList T)

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1:Data ; D2:Data, set _ T) =>
       SetItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1, T)) SetItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D2, T))

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1:Data ; D2:Data ; DL:DataList, set _ T) =>
       SetItem(#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D1, T)) {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(D2 ; DL, set .AnnotationList T)}:>Set
```

Maps and big\_maps do not have the same parsing ambiguity, so we do not need to handle the case of size 1 maps separately.  Note that, internally, no difference exists between maps and big\_maps in K-Michelson.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ }, map _ _ _) => .Map
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ M:MapEntryList }, map _:AnnotationList KT VT) =>
       #ConcreteArgToSemantics(M, map .AnnotationList KT VT)

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Elt K V ; ML, map _:AnnotationList KT VT) =>
       ({#ConcreteArgToSemantics(ML, map .AnnotationList KT VT)}:>Map)[#ConcreteArgToSemantics(K, KT) <- #ConcreteArgToSemantics(V, VT)]

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Elt K V, map _:AnnotationList KT VT) =>
       #ConcreteArgToSemantics(K, KT) |-> #ConcreteArgToSemantics(V, VT)

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ }, big_map _:AnnotationList K V) => .Map

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ M:MapEntryList }, big_map _:AnnotationList K V) =>
       #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ M:MapEntryList }, map .AnnotationList K V)  // We handle big_map literals as maps.
```

We construct a contract datatype from its string address and type.  Note that, for convenience, we do not enforce that this address exists in the other\_contracts map!

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S:String, contract _ T) => #Contract(#ParseAddress(S), T)

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(#Typed(D, T), T) => #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D, T)
```

These two helper functions extract type information from a Contract.  Note that by using more complex K syntax their existence could be avoided, but we feel this is more readable.

```k
  syntax Type ::= #ParameterTypeFromContract(Contract) [function]
  rule #ParameterTypeFromContract(code _ ; storage _ ; parameter P ;) => P

  syntax Type ::= #StorageTypeFromContract(Contract) [function]
  rule #StorageTypeFromContract(code _ ; storage P ; parameter _ ;) => P
```

These rules exists for the unit testing semantics - operations are not legal data literals in normal Michelson.  Note that we need to recurse into the data elements.

```k
  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Create_contract(N, C, O, M, S), operation _) =>
       Create_contract(
           N,
           C,
           {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(O, (option .AnnotationList  key_hash .AnnotationList))}:>OptionData,
           {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(M, mutez .AnnotationList)}:>Mutez,
           #ConcreteArgToSemantics(S, #StorageTypeFromContract(C))
       )

  rule #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Set_delegate(N, K), operation _) =>
       Set_delegate(N, {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(K, (option .AnnotationList key_hash .AnnotationList))}:>OptionData)
```

These rules use the K syntax for a `withConfig` function.  This attribute allows a function read-only access to the K configuration, and is necessary here to avoid needing an explicit configuration argument in all other rules.  We need the configuration because we need to be able to construct a `contract` value from an address specified in the `Transfer_tokens` production, and thus need to perform a contract lookup.

```k
  syntax Type ::= #TypeFromOtherContract(ContractData) [function]
  rule #TypeFromOtherContract(#Contract(_, T)) => T

  rule [[ #ConcreteArgToSemantics(Transfer_tokens(N, P, M, A), operation _)
          => Transfer_tokens(N,
              #ConcreteArgToSemantics(
                  P,
                  #TypeFromOtherContract({Known[#ConcreteArgToSemantics(A, address .AnnotationList)]}:>ContractData)
              ),
              {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(M, mutez .AnnotationList)}:>Mutez,
              {#ConcreteArgToSemantics(A, address .AnnotationList)}:>Address
          ) ]]
       <knownaddrs> Known </knownaddrs>
       requires #ConcreteArgToSemantics(A, address .AnnotationList) in_keys(Known)
```

We extract a big\_map by index from the bigmaps map.  Note that these have already been converted to K-internal form, so there is no need to recurse here.

```k
  rule [[ #ConcreteArgToSemantics(I:Int, big_map _:AnnotationList K V) => {M[I]}:>Data ]]
       <bigmaps> M:Map </bigmaps>
```

The `#GroupOrder` function maps groups onto integers to create a total order of groups.  Groups will be loaded ascending order according to the Int this function maps them to.

It is permitted, but not recommended, for two groups to have the same order (unless they are mutually exclusive, such as `code` and `contract`).  It is imperative, however, that groups which depend on loaded information from other groups have a **strictly higher** order than their dependencies.

```k
  syntax Int ::= #GroupOrder(Group) [function]
```

In order to specify that a group should be loaded last, we map it on to `#GroupOrderMax` (subtracting an offset in the event we wish a group to be loaded second to last).

The actual value returned by this function is immaterial, so long as it is larger than the number of groups.

```k
  syntax Int ::= "#GroupOrderMax" [function]
  rule #GroupOrderMax => 1000
```

These are the default group orders.  If a new extension semantics adds a new group, it should also define an order for that group with a rule like these.

```k
  rule #GroupOrder(_:ContractGroup) => #GroupOrderMax
  rule #GroupOrder(_:ParameterValueGroup) => #GroupOrderMax -Int 1
  rule #GroupOrder(_:StorageValueGroup) => #GroupOrderMax -Int 2

  rule #GroupOrder(_:NowGroup) => 0
  rule #GroupOrder(_:SenderGroup) => 1
  rule #GroupOrder(_:SourceGroup) => 2
  rule #GroupOrder(_:ChainGroup) => 3
  rule #GroupOrder(_:SelfGroup) => 4
  rule #GroupOrder(_:AmountGroup) => 5
  rule #GroupOrder(_:BalanceGroup) => 6
  rule #GroupOrder(_:BigMapGroup) => 7
  rule #GroupOrder(_:ContractsGroup) => 8
  rule #GroupOrder(_:ParameterDecl) => 9
  rule #GroupOrder(_:StorageDecl) => 10
```

As implied by the name, these rules implement an insertion sort of a loading groups list.  This is, by far, the simplest sort to implement in K, and since no file will require more than 15 loading groups (and the vast majority require far fewer), its performance drawbacks should be unnoticable.

```k
  syntax Groups ::= #InsertInOrder(Groups, Group) [function]
  rule #InsertInOrder(G1:Group, G2:Group) => G1 ; G2              requires #GroupOrder(G1) <Int #GroupOrder(G2)
  rule #InsertInOrder(G1:Group, G2:Group) => G2 ; G1              requires #GroupOrder(G1) >=Int #GroupOrder(G2)
  rule #InsertInOrder(G1 ; Gs, G2) => G1 ; #InsertInOrder(Gs, G2) requires #GroupOrder(G1) <Int #GroupOrder(G2)
  rule #InsertInOrder(G1 ; Gs, G2) => G2 ; G1 ; Gs                requires #GroupOrder(G1) >=Int #GroupOrder(G2)

  syntax Groups ::= #InsertionSort(Groups) [function] // Note that this is a *stable* insertion sort.
  rule #InsertionSort(G:Group) => G
  rule #InsertionSort(G:Group;) => G
  rule #InsertionSort(G ; Gs) => #InsertInOrder(#InsertionSort(Gs), G)
```

This function seeks out a contract loading group in a list of groups.  It should be used only if `#HasContract` has already returned true.

```k
  syntax Contract ::= #FindContract(Groups) [function]
  rule #FindContract(contract { C }) => C
  rule #FindContract(contract { C } ;) => C
  rule #FindContract(contract { C } ; _) => C
  rule #FindContract(_ ; Gs) => #FindContract(Gs) [owise]
```

These functions create Parameter and Storage loading groups respectively from the parameter and storage primitive applications in a contract.

```k
  syntax Group ::= #MakeParameterGroup(Groups) [function]
  rule #MakeParameterGroup(G) => parameter #ParameterTypeFromContract(#FindContract(G))

  syntax Group ::= #MakeStorageGroup(Groups) [function]
  rule #MakeStorageGroup(G) => storage #StorageTypeFromContract(#FindContract(G))
```

This function determines whether or not a contract group exists in a loading group list.

```k
  syntax Bool ::= #HasContract(Groups) [function]
  rule #HasContract(contract { C }) => true
  rule #HasContract(contract { C } ; _) => true
  rule #HasContract(G ;) => #HasContract(G)
  rule #HasContract(_ ; Gs) => #HasContract(Gs) [owise]
  rule #HasContract(_:Group) => false [owise]
```

This function takes a loading group list and extends it with a Parameter and Storage group (determining the *type* of the contract's parameter and storage respectively) if a contract loading group exists.

```k
  syntax Groups ::= #ExtendGroups(Groups) [function]

  rule #ExtendGroups(Gs) => #MakeParameterGroup(Gs) ; #MakeStorageGroup(Gs) ; Gs requires #HasContract(Gs)
  rule #ExtendGroups(Gs) => Gs [owise]
```

This group performs the loading initial loading step of passing the loading groups to the `#LoadGroups` production after sorting them and extending them as necessary.  This rule is marked with the owise attribute so that semantic extensions can override this behavior, and indeed many of the compatibility script extensions do so.

```k
  rule <k> G:Groups => #LoadGroups(#InsertionSort(#ExtendGroups(G))) </k> [owise]
```

Loading a `now` group simply involves setting the contents of the now timestamp to the contained integer.  Similarly simple logic applies to sender, source, chain\_id and self.

```k
  rule <k> #LoadGroups(now I ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <mynow> #Timestamp(0 => I) </mynow>

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(sender A ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <senderaddr> #Address("InvalidSenderAddr" => A) </senderaddr>

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(source A ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <sourceaddr> #Address("InvalidSourceAddr" => A) </sourceaddr>

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(chain_id M ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <mychainid> #ChainId(_ => M) </mychainid>

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(self A ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <myaddr> #Address("InvalidMyAddr" => A) </myaddr>
```

Amount and balance require slightly more logic to verify that the value they're being set to is actually a legal mutez value, but are otherwise relatively simple.

```k
  rule <k> #LoadGroups(amount I ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <myamount> #Mutez(0 => I) </myamount>
       requires #IsLegalMutezValue(I)

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(balance I ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <mybalance> #Mutez(0 => I) </mybalance>
       requires #IsLegalMutezValue(I)
```

Loading the other contracts map involves transforming its map entry list style concrete representation to a K-Michelson map.

```k
  syntax Map ::= #OtherContractsMapToKMap(OtherContractsMap) [function]
  syntax Map ::= #OtherContractsMapEntryListToKMap(OtherContractsMapEntryList) [function]
  rule #OtherContractsMapToKMap({ }) => .Map
  rule #OtherContractsMapToKMap({ EL }) => #OtherContractsMapEntryListToKMap(EL)
  rule #OtherContractsMapEntryListToKMap( Elt A T ) => #Address(A) |-> #Contract(#Address(A), T)
  rule #OtherContractsMapEntryListToKMap( Elt A T ; Rs ) => #Address(A) |-> #Contract(#Address(A), T) #OtherContractsMapEntryListToKMap(Rs)

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(other_contracts M ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <knownaddrs> .Map => #OtherContractsMapToKMap(M) </knownaddrs>
```

These two groups contain information from the contract itself, but they are promoted to loading groups due to data dependency orders.  Specifically, if we left these as part of the contract, we would need to load the parameter\_value and storage\_value groups after the contract so we know what types we're working with, but we need to load those groups before the contract so the contract can execute with the appropriate starting state.  Extracting these groups solves the cyclical ordering problem.

```k
  rule <k> #LoadGroups(parameter T ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <paramtype> #NotSet => T </paramtype>

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(storage T ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <storagetype> #NotSet => T </storagetype>
```

Similar to the other\_contracts rule, we need to transform BigMaps into the appropriate K-Michelson type.

```k
  syntax Map ::= #BigMapsToKMap(BigMapMap) [function]
  syntax Map ::= #BigMapsEntryListToKMap(BigMapEntryList) [function]
  syntax Map ::= #BigMapsEntryToKMap(BigMapEntry) [function]

  rule #BigMapsToKMap({ }) => .Map
  rule #BigMapsToKMap({ EL }) => #BigMapsEntryListToKMap(EL)

  rule #BigMapsEntryListToKMap(E) => #BigMapsEntryToKMap(E)
  rule #BigMapsEntryListToKMap(E ; Es) => #BigMapsEntryToKMap(E) #BigMapsEntryListToKMap(Es)

  rule #BigMapsEntryToKMap(Big_map I T1 T2 { }) =>
    I |-> #ConcreteArgToSemantics({ }, big_map .AnnotationList T1 T2)

  rule #BigMapsEntryToKMap(Big_map I T1 T2 ML:MapLiteral) =>
    I |-> #ConcreteArgToSemantics(ML, big_map .AnnotationList T1 T2)

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(big_maps M ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <bigmaps> .Map => #BigMapsToKMap(M) </bigmaps>
```

These groups contain the actual parameter and storage values passed to the contract, they must be loaded after their respective type is set so that the `#ConcreteArgToSemantics` function can determine what type it should be parsing.

```k
  rule <k> #LoadGroups(parameter_value D ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <paramtype> T </paramtype>
       <paramvalue> #NoData => #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D, T) </paramvalue>

  rule <k> #LoadGroups(storage_value D ; Gs => Gs) </k>
       <storagetype> T </storagetype>
       <storagevalue> #NoData => #ConcreteArgToSemantics(D, T) </storagevalue>
```

This rule tolerates multiple contract groups in the same file by selecting one of them to execute.  Strictly speaking such a file would be malformed, but allowing the external parser to give us such malformed files allows us to avoid to parse the given script *three* times.

```k
  rule <k> #LoadGroups(C:ContractGroup ; Cs) => #LoadGroups(C) </k>
```

The final loading group in this file is the contract group.  The storage and parameter values are combined and the stack is initialized, and then the code is extracted so that we can move on to the execution semantics.

```k
  rule <k> #LoadGroups(contract { code C ; storage _ ; parameter _ ; }) => C </k>
       <stack> . => Pair P S </stack>
       <paramvalue> P </paramvalue>
       <storagevalue> S </storagevalue>
```

#Execution Semantics

These rules split apart blocks into KItems so that the main semantic rules can use idiomatic K.

```k
  rule #Exec(Is) => Is

  rule TI:TypedInstruction ; TIS => TI ~> TIS

  rule <k> #TI(I, T1 -> T2) => I ... </k>
       <stacktypes> _ => T1 </stacktypes>

  rule I:Instruction ; Is => I ~> Is
  rule {} => .K [structrual]
  rule { Is:DataList } => Is
//  rule I:Data ; => I [anywhere]
```

For now, annotations are simply ignored.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #HandleAnnotations(AnnotationList)
  rule #HandleAnnotations(_) => .
```

This production contains error information when a contract fails at runtime.  Its arguments are:

1. An error message.
2. The top element of the stack (the argument to `FAILWITH`)
3. The remainder of the stack.
4. The remainder of the K cell.

```k
  syntax Error ::= Aborted(String, KItem, K, K)

  // Core Instructioons
  //// Control Structures
  rule <k> FAILWITH A ~> Rk => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> Aborted("FAILWITH instruction reached", D, Rk, Rs) </k>
       <stack> D ~> Rs => ( Failed D ) </stack>
       <returncode> _ => 1 </returncode>
```

The control flow instruction's implementations in K should look extremely similar to their formal description in the [Michelson documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/whitedoc/michelson.html#control-structures).  Keeping this similarity, unless absolutely prevented for performance or K style reasons, was a major design goal of the semantics.

```k
  rule <k> IF A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BT ... </k>
       <stack> true => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BF ... </k>
       <stack> false => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> LOOP A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ~> LOOP .AnnotationList B ... </k>
       <stack> true => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> LOOP A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> false => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> LOOP_LEFT A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ~> LOOP_LEFT .AnnotationList B ... </k>
       <stack> Left D => D ... </stack>

  rule <k> LOOP_LEFT A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> Right D => D ... </stack>
```

It is sometimes useful to create "pseudo-instructions" like this to schedule operations to happen in the future.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #Push(Data)
  rule <k> #Push(D) => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => D ... </stack>
```

The DIP instruction uses the `#Push` pseudo-instruction to replace the element it pops off for its block.

```k
  rule <k> DIP A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ~> #Push(D) ... </k>
       <stack> D:Data => . ... </stack>
```

The multiple DIP instruction is defined recursively

```k
  rule <k> DIP A 0 B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ... </k>

  rule <k> DIP A I B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> DIP .AnnotationList { DIP .AnnotationList  I -Int 1 B } ... </k>
       requires I >Int 0
```

This pseudo-instruction implements the behavior of restoring the previous stack when a lambda completes execution.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #ReturnStack(K)

  rule <k> #ReturnStack(Ls) => . ... </k>
       <stack> R:Data => R ~> Ls </stack>
```

An EXEC instruction replaces the stack and schedules the restoration of the old stack after the completion of the lambda code.

```k
  rule <k> EXEC B => #HandleAnnotations(B) ~> C ~> #ReturnStack(Rs) ... </k>
       <stack> A:Data ~> #Lambda(_, _, C):Data ~> Rs:K => A </stack>
```

APPLY demonstrates why lambdas have their type information preserved, as otherwise we would be unable to produce an appropriate `PUSH` instruction for the expanded lambda.

```k
  rule <k> APPLY A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> D:Data ~> #Lambda(pair _:AnnotationList T0 T1, T2, { C } ) => #Lambda(T1, T2, { PUSH .AnnotationList T0 D ; PAIR .AnnotationList ; { C } } ) ... </stack>
```

`DROP n` is implemented in a recursive style, like in the Michelson documentation.

```k
  ////Stack operations

  rule <k> DROP A =>  #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> _:Data => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> DROP A I => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> DROP .AnnotationList ~> DROP .AnnotationList I -Int 1 ... </k>
       requires I >Int 0

  rule <k> DROP A 0 => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
```

DUP and SWAP are essentially lifted directly from the docs.

```k
  rule <k> DUP A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X:Data => X ~> X ... </stack>

  rule <k> SWAP A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X:Data ~> Y:Data => Y ~> X ... </stack>
```

Dig is implemented in 2 phases, digging down and building back up.  This is implemented with the following production, which functions essentially like a FSM.  When I > 0, we push elements into the internal stack after popping them from the main stack.  When I = 0, we have found the element to move to the top and can save it.  When I = -1, we need to start unwinding the inner stack and restoring the elements under the selected one.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #DoDig(Int, K, OptionData)

  rule <k> DIG A I => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> #DoDig(I, .K, None) ... </k>
       <stack> S </stack>

  rule <k> #DoDig(I, A, None) => #DoDig(I -Int 1, F ~> A, None) ... </k>
       <stack> F:Data => . ... </stack>
       requires I >Int 0

  rule <k> #DoDig(0, A, None) => #DoDig(-1, A, Some F) ... </k>
       <stack> F:Data => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> #DoDig(-1, F:Data ~> A, Some T) => #DoDig(-1, A, Some T) ... </k>
       <stack> . => F ... </stack>

  rule <k> #DoDig(-1, .K, Some T) => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => T ... </stack>
```

Dug is implemented similar to Dig, except the element to move is saved immediately rather than waiting for I = 0.  Instead it is placed when I = 0.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #DoDug(Int, K, Data)

  rule <k> DUG A I => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> #DoDug(I, .K, T) ... </k>
       <stack> T => .K ... </stack>

  rule <k> #DoDug(I, S, R) => #DoDug(I -Int 1, T ~> S, R) ... </k>
       <stack> T:Data => .K ... </stack>
       requires I >Int 0

  rule <k> #DoDug(0, S, R) => #DoDug(-1, S, R) ... </k>
       <stack> .K => R ... </stack>

  rule <k> #DoDug(-1, T:Data ~> S, R) => #DoDug(-1, S, R) ... </k>
       <stack> .K => T ... </stack>

  rule <k> #DoDug(-1, .K, _) => .K ... </k>
```

PUSH needs to convert its argument to semantics form, but otherwise matches the documentation directly.

```k
  rule <k> PUSH A T X => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> . => #ConcreteArgToSemantics(X, T) ... </stack>
```

UNIT and LAMBDA are implemented almost exactly as specified in the documentation.

```k
  rule <k> UNIT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> . => Unit ... </stack>

  rule <k> LAMBDA A T1 T2 C => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> . => #Lambda(T1, T2, C) ... </stack>
```

Comparisons map directly onto K Int functions.

```k
  //// Generic Comparisons

  rule <k> EQ A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => I ==Int 0 ... </stack>

  rule <k> NEQ A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => I =/=Int 0 ... </stack>

  rule <k> LT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => I <Int 0 ... </stack>

  rule <k> GT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => I >Int 0 ... </stack>

  rule <k> LE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => I <=Int 0 ... </stack>

  rule <k> GE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => I >=Int 0 ... </stack>
```

As do basic boolean functions.

```k
  // Operations
  //// Operations on booleans
  rule <k> OR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B1 ~> B2 => B1 orBool B2 ...  </stack>

  rule <k> AND A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B1 ~> B2 => B1 andBool B2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> XOR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B1 ~> B2 => B1 xorBool B2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> NOT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B => notBool B ... </stack>
```

Negation and taking absolute value are similarly trivial.

```k
  //// Operations on integers and natural numbers
  rule <k> NEG A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => 0 -Int I ... </stack>

  rule <k> ABS A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => absInt(I) ... </stack>
```

ISNAT could be implemented in a single rule with the `#if _ #then _ #else _ #fi` structure, but I think this is easier to read.

```k
  rule <k> ISNAT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => Some I ... </stack>
       requires I >=Int 0

  rule <k> ISNAT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => None ... </stack>
       requires I <Int 0
```

Since Ints and Nats are both represented by the Int sort in K, INT is a noop.

```k
  rule <k> INT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I:Int ... </stack>
```

Basic arithmetic operations map directly.

```k
  rule <k> ADD A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => I1 +Int I2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> SUB A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => I1 -Int I2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> MUL A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => I1 *Int I2 ... </stack>
```

EDIV could, like ISNAT, probably be written in one rule, but this is probably easier to interpret.

```k
  rule <k> EDIV A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1:Int ~> 0 => None ... </stack>
       // Could combine this rule with the Mutez one but probably a disadvantage in readability.

  rule <k> EDIV A  => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => Some (Pair (I1 /Int I2) (I1 %Int I2)) ... </stack>
       requires I2 =/=Int 0
```

Bitwise operations on ints map directly onto K functions over ints.

```k
  rule <k> OR A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => I1 |Int I2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> AND A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => I1 &Int I2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> XOR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> I2 => I1 xorInt I2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> NOT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I => ~Int I ... </stack>
```

These rules are interesting mainly for their failure cases, which rewrite the k cell to an Aborted production.

```k
  rule <k> LSL A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X ~> S => X <<Int S ... </stack>
       requires S <=Int 256

  rule <k> LSL A ~> Rk => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> Aborted("LSL out of range", S, Rk, Rs) </k>
       <stack> C:Int ~> S:Int ~> Rs => ( GeneralOverflow C S )  </stack>
       requires S >Int 256

  rule <k> LSR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X ~> S => X >>Int S ... </stack>
       requires S <=Int 256

  rule <k> LSR A ~> Rk => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> Aborted("LSR out of range", S, Rk, Rs) </k>
       <stack> X ~> S ~> Rs => ( GeneralOverflow X S ) </stack>
       requires S >Int 256
```

We lift the COMPARE operation to a function over Data, allowing many different instantiations of the COMPARE operation to be implemented in fewer rules.

```k
  syntax Int ::= #DoCompare(Data, Data) [function]

  rule #DoCompare(true, true) => 0
  rule #DoCompare(false, false) => 0
  rule #DoCompare(false, true) => -1
  rule #DoCompare(true, false) => 1

  rule #DoCompare(I1:Int, I2:Int) => -1 requires I1 <Int I2 [concrete(I1,I2)]
  rule #DoCompare(I1:Int, I2:Int) => 0 requires I1 ==Int I2 [concrete(I1,I2)]
  rule #DoCompare(I1:Int, I2:Int) => 1 requires I1 >Int I2  [concrete(I1,I2)]

  rule #DoCompare(S1:String, S2:String) => -1 requires S1 <String S2
  rule #DoCompare(S1:String, S2:String) => 0 requires S1 ==String S2
  rule #DoCompare(S1:String, S2:String) => 1 requires S1 >String S2

  rule #DoCompare((Pair A1 A2), (Pair B1 B2)) => -1                 requires #DoCompare(A1, B1) ==Int -1
  rule #DoCompare((Pair A1 A2), (Pair B1 B2)) => #DoCompare(A2, B2) requires #DoCompare(A1, B1) ==Int 0
  rule #DoCompare((Pair A1 A2), (Pair B1 B2)) => 1                  requires #DoCompare(A1, B1) ==Int 1

  rule <k> COMPARE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> V1 ~> V2 => #DoCompare(V1, V2) ... </stack>
```

CONCAT is complicated by the fact that it is defined differently over strings and bytes, and so we need type information to select the correct implementation.  This is no problem for non-empty lists, but CONCATing an empty list of strings should produce "", whereas CONCATing an empty list of bytes should produce 0x.  We use the type information stored in #List to try to determine this, but the case of lists produced with MAP cannot be solved without a full type system, which is currently out of scope.

```k
  syntax String ::= #ConcatStrings(List, String) [function]
  rule #ConcatStrings(.List, A) => A
  rule #ConcatStrings(ListItem(S1) DL, A) => #ConcatStrings(DL, A +String S1)

  //// Operations on strings
  rule <k> CONCAT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> S1 ~> S2 => S1 +String S2 ... </stack>

  rule <k> CONCAT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> L => #ConcatStrings(L, "") ... </stack>
       <stacktypes> list _ string _ ; _ </stacktypes>

  rule <k> SIZE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> S => lengthString(S) ... </stack>
```

The actual out of bounds conditions here are determined by experimentation.  Earlier versions of the semantics didn't check if O was in bounds, resulting in `Slice("", 0, 0) => Some ""` rather than the correct `#SliceString("", 0, 0) => None`

```k
  syntax OptionData ::= #SliceString(String, Int, Int) [function]

  rule #SliceString(S, O, L) => Some substrString(S, O, O +Int L)
  requires O >=Int 0 andBool L >=Int 0 andBool O <Int lengthString(S) andBool (O +Int L) <=Int lengthString(S)

  rule #SliceString(S, O, L) => None [owise]

  rule <k> SLICE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> O ~> L ~> S => #SliceString(S, O, L)  ... </stack>
```

Pair operations lift directly from the documentation.

```k
  //// Operations on pairs
  rule <k> PAIR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> L ~> R => Pair L R ... </stack>

  rule <k> UNPAIR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> Pair L R => L ~> R ... </stack>

  rule <k> CAR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> Pair L _ => L ... </stack>

  rule <k> CDR A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> Pair _ R => R ... </stack>
```

Sets in Michelson are implemented using the K hooked set implementation.  This allows many Michelson operation, like MEM, to lift directly to Set functions.

```k
  //// Operations on sets
  rule <k> EMPTY_SET A _ => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> . => .Set ... </stack>

  rule <k> MEM A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X ~> S:Set => X in S ... </stack>
```

Built-in support for sets allows clean rules like the ones below for adding and removing elements from the set respectively.

```k
  // True to insert, False to remove.

  rule <k> UPDATE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> D ~> true ~> S => SetItem(D) S ... </stack>

  rule <k> UPDATE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> D ~> false ~> SetItem(D) S => S ... </stack>

  rule <k> UPDATE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> (D ~> false => .) ~> S:Set ... </stack>
       requires notBool(D in S)
```

Note that, according to the Michelson documentation, set iteration order is actually defined (the set is iterated over in ascending order)!  For simplicity we implement this by repeatedly selecting the minimal element.

```k
  syntax Data ::= #MinimalElement(List) [function]
  syntax Data ::= #MinimalElementAux(List, Data) [function]

  rule #MinimalElement(ListItem(H) L) => #MinimalElementAux(L, H)
  rule #MinimalElementAux(.List, M) => M
  rule #MinimalElementAux(ListItem(H) L, M) => #MinimalElementAux(L, M) requires #DoCompare(M, H) <=Int 0
  rule #MinimalElementAux(ListItem(H) L, M) => #MinimalElementAux(L, H) requires #DoCompare(M, H) ==Int 1

  rule <k> ITER A _ => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> .Set => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> ITER A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ~> #Push(S -Set SetItem(#MinimalElement(Set2List(S)))) ~> ITER .AnnotationList B ... </k>
       <stack> S => #MinimalElement(Set2List(S)) ... </stack>
       requires size(S) >Int 0
```

Set size is lifts directly into Michelson.

```k
  rule <k> SIZE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> S:Set => size(S) ... </stack>
```

Much like Sets, MAP operations lift reasonably easily into K.

```k
  //// Operations on maps
  rule <k> EMPTY_MAP A _ _ => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> . => .Map ... </stack>

  rule <k> GET A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X ~> M => Some {M[X]}:>Data ... </stack>
       requires X in_keys(M)

  rule <k> GET A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X ~> M => None ... </stack>
       requires notBool(X in_keys(M))

  rule <k> MEM A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> . ... </k>
       <stack> X ~> M => X in_keys(M) ... </stack>

  rule <k> UPDATE A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> K ~> Some V ~> M:Map => M[K <- V] ... </stack>

  rule <k> UPDATE A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> K ~> None ~> M:Map => M[K <- undef] ... </stack>
```

The MAP operation, over maps, is somewhat more involved.  We need to set up a stack without the actual map to execute the block on, and we need to keep track of the updated map as we do.  We implement this by splitting the operation into multiple K items.  `#PerformMap` holds the old map, the new map, and the block to execute.  When it rewrites, it sets up the new stack and queues up a `#PopNewVal` which removes the value produced by the MAP block and adds it to the second map argument.  Like Sets, iteration order is actually defined, and we implement it by repeatedly selecting the minimal element in the list of keys in the map.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #PerformMap(Map, Map, Block)

  rule <k> MAP A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> #PerformMap(M, .Map, B) ... </k>
       <stack> M => . ... </stack>

  syntax KItem ::= #PopNewVal(Data)

  rule <k> #PopNewVal(K) ~> #PerformMap(M1, M2, B) => #PerformMap(M1, M2[K <- V], B) ... </k>
       <stack> V => . ... </stack>

  syntax Data ::= #MinimalKey(Map) [function]
  rule #MinimalKey(M) => #MinimalElement(keys_list(M))

  rule <k> #PerformMap(M1, M2, B) => B ~> #PopNewVal(#MinimalKey(M1))
        ~> #PerformMap(M1[#MinimalKey(M1) <- undef], M2, B) ... </k>
       <stack> . => Pair #MinimalKey(M1) {M1[#MinimalKey(M1)]}:>Data ... </stack>
       requires size(M1) >Int 0

  rule <k> #PerformMap(.Map, M, _) => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => M ... </stack>
```

Iter is relatively easy to implement using a straightforward recursive style, since it does not need to track the new map while keeping it off the stack.

```k
  rule <k> ITER A B => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> .Map => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> ITER A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ~> #Push(M[#MinimalKey(M) <- undef]) ~> ITER .AnnotationList B ... </k>
       <stack> M:Map => Pair #MinimalKey(M) {M[#MinimalKey(M)]}:>Data ... </stack>
       requires size(M) >Int 0
```

SIZE lifts direclty into K.

```k
  rule <k> SIZE A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> M:Map => size(M) ... </stack>
```

For the purposes of this semantics, big\_maps are represented in the same way as maps, so they can reuse the same execution rules.

```k
  //// Operations on big maps

  rule <k> EMPTY_BIG_MAP A _ _ => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> . => .Map ... </stack>

  // Same as maps
```

Option operations are relatively straightforward translations of the Michelson documentation into rewrite rules.

```k
  //// Operations on optional values

  rule <k> SOME A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> X => Some X ... </stack>

  rule <k> NONE A _ => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> . => None ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_NONE A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BT ... </k>
       <stack> None => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_NONE A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BF ... </k>
       <stack> Some V => V ... </stack>
```

Sum types are similar to options.

```k
  //// Operations on unions
  rule <k> LEFT A _ => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> X:Data => Left X ... </stack>

  rule <k> RIGHT A _:Type => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> X:Data => Right X ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_LEFT A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BT ... </k>
       <stack> Left V => V ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_LEFT A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BF ... </k>
       <stack> Right V => V ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_RIGHT A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BT ... </k>
       <stack> Right V => V ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_RIGHT A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BF ... </k>
       <stack> Left V => V ... </stack>
```

Lists are somewhat nontrivial in that we need to keep track of typing information and hence we have the `#List` nonterminal.  Aside from that, the rules are a direct translation of the documentation into K.

```k
  //// Operations on lists
  rule <k> CONS A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> V ~> L:List => ListItem(V) L ... </stack>

  rule <k> NIL A _ => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> . => .List ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_CONS A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BT ... </k>
       <stack> ListItem(L1) Ls => L1 ~> Ls ... </stack>

  rule <k> IF_CONS A BT BF => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> BF ... </k>
       <stack> .List => . ... </stack>
```

Note that, like Maps, Lists must keep track of the updated list on the fly during a `MAP` operation.  We cannot currently determine the type of the result list as we do not have a static type system.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #PerformMapList(List, List, Block)

  rule <k> MAP A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> #PerformMapList(Ls, .List, B) ... </k>
       <stack> Ls => . ... </stack>
```

The accumulator list in `#PerformMapList` is actually backwards, so we need to reverse it before placing it back onto the stack.

```k
  syntax List ::= #ReverseList(List) [function]
  syntax List ::= #ReverseListAux(List, List) [function]
  rule #ReverseList(L) => #ReverseListAux(L, .List)
  rule #ReverseListAux(ListItem(L1) Ls, Acc) => #ReverseListAux(Ls, ListItem(L1) Acc)
  rule #ReverseListAux(.List, Acc) => Acc

  rule <k> #PerformMapList(.List, Acc, B) => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => #ReverseList(Acc) ... </stack>
```

As with maps, before we execute a `MAP` block we must add the first element in the input list to the stack and schedule an `#AddToList` to pop the result off the stack.

```k
  syntax KItem ::= #AddToList(List, List, Block)
  rule <k> #PerformMapList(ListItem(L) Ls, Acc, B) => B ~> #AddToList(Ls, Acc, B) ... </k>
       <stack> . => L ... </stack>

  rule <k> #AddToList(Ls, Acc, B) => #PerformMapList(Ls, ListItem(L) Acc, B) ... </k>
       <stack> L => . ... </stack>
```

Size and iter have relatively simple implementations.

```k
  rule <k> SIZE A => #HandleAnnotations(A)  ... </k>
       <stack> L:List => size(L) ... </stack>

  rule <k> ITER A B =>  #HandleAnnotations(A) ~>. ... </k>
       <stack> .List => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> ITER A B => #HandleAnnotations(A) ~> B ~> #Push(Ls) ~> ITER .AnnotationList B ... </k>
       <stack> ListItem(L) Ls => L ... </stack>
```

Timestamps are simply wrapped ints in K-Michelson, so the implementation of simple arithmetic over them is straightforward.  The differing argument types however forces us to use two rules for each operation.

```k
  // Domain Specific operations
  //// Operations on timestamps
  rule <k> ADD A => . ... </k>
       <stack> #Timestamp(I1) ~> I2 => #Timestamp(I1 +Int I2) ... </stack>

  rule <k> ADD A => . ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> #Timestamp(I2) => #Timestamp(I1 +Int I2) ... </stack>

  rule <k> SUB A => . ... </k>
       <stack> #Timestamp(I1) ~> I2 => #Timestamp(I1 -Int I2) ... </stack>

  rule <k> SUB A => . ... </k>
       <stack> #Timestamp(I1) ~> #Timestamp(I2) => I1 -Int I2 ... </stack>

  rule #DoCompare(#Timestamp(I1), #Timestamp(I2)) => #DoCompare(I1, I2)
```

Operations instructions mostly simply sanity check their arguments and then package them into the appropriate operation structure from michelson-internal-syntax.md.  Of interest in the `CREATE_CONTRACT` instructon is the `!_:Int` syntax, which simply generates a fresh integer that has not been used by this rule during this execution.  This ensures that two different `CREATE_CONTRACT` executions will produce different addresses.

```k
  rule <k> CREATE_CONTRACT A:AnnotationList { C } => . ... </k>
       <stack> Delegate:OptionData ~> Initial:Mutez ~> Stor:Data => Create_contract(O, C, Delegate, Initial, Stor) ~> #Address("@Address(" +String Int2String(!_:Int) +String ")") ... </stack>
       <nonce> #Nonce(O) => #NextNonce(#Nonce(O)) </nonce>

  rule <k> TRANSFER_TOKENS _ => . ... </k>
       <stack> D ~> M ~> #Contract(A, _) => Transfer_tokens(O, D, M, A) ... </stack>
       <nonce> #Nonce(O) => #NextNonce(#Nonce(O)) </nonce>

  rule <k> SET_DELEGATE A => . ... </k>
       <stack> D => Set_delegate(O, D) ... </stack>
       <nonce> #Nonce(O) => #NextNonce(#Nonce(O)) </nonce>
```

The Balance instruction simply pushes the value stored in the mybalance cell.

```k
  rule <k> BALANCE A => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => B ... </stack>
       <mybalance> B </mybalance>
```

The ADDRESS instruction simply takes the address field of the contract structure and discards the rest.

```k
  rule <k> ADDRESS Ann => . ... </k>
       <stack> #Contract(A, _) => A ... </stack>

We need to perform a type check in order to correctly implement the CONTRACT instruction since it should return None if a contract with a different parameter type exists at the given address.  This requires us to extract the type from the stored contract.  This is possible without another rule through more advanced K syntax but using a simple helper function seems more readable.

```k
  syntax Type ::= #TypeFromContractStruct(Data) [function]
  rule #TypeFromContractStruct(#Contract(_, T)) => T

  rule <k> CONTRACT _ T => . ... </k>
       <stack> A => Some {M[A]}:>Data ... </stack>
       <knownaddrs> M </knownaddrs>
       requires A in_keys(M) andBool #TypeFromContractStruct({M[A]}:>Data) ==K T

  rule <k> CONTRACT _ T => . ... </k>
       <stack> A:Address => None ... </stack>
       <knownaddrs> M </knownaddrs> [owise]
```

Like Balance, these instructions simply push the contents of the corresponding cells.

```k
  rule <k> SOURCE Ann => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => A ... </stack>
       <sourceaddr> A </sourceaddr>

  rule <k> SENDER Ann => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => A ... </stack>
       <senderaddr> A </senderaddr>

  rule <k> SELF Ann => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => #Contract(A, T) ... </stack>
       <paramtype> T </paramtype>
       <myaddr> A </myaddr>

  rule <k> AMOUNT Ann => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => M ... </stack>
       <myamount> M </myamount>
```

`IMPLICIT_ACCOUNT` adds the additional information that the type of any such account is unit.

```k
  rule <k> IMPLICIT_ACCOUNT Ann => . ... </k>
       <stack> #KeyHash(A) => #Contract(#Address(A), unit .AnnotationList) ... </stack>

  //// Special Operations
  rule <k> CHAIN_ID A => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => C ... </stack>
       <mychainid> C </mychainid>

  rule <k> NOW A => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => N ... </stack>
       <mynow> N </mynow>
```

The bytes instructions have a stubbed implementation for the time being, since the actual serialization format is unspecified.

```k
  //// Operations on MBytes, stubbed for now because of the lack of a documented bytes format.
  rule <k> PACK A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> T => #Packed(T) ... </stack>

  rule <k> UNPACK A _ => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Packed(T) => Some T ... </stack>
```

The concat operation over two bytes is relatively straightforward since we already have helper functions to extract bytes content.

```k
  rule <k> CONCAT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B1:Bytes ~> B2:Bytes => B1 +Bytes B2 ... </stack>
```

Concatenating lists of bytes is somewhat more involved, since we need to distinguish this case from lists of strings.

```k
  syntax Bytes ::= #ConcatBytes(List, Bytes) [function]
  rule #ConcatBytes(.List, A) => A
  rule #ConcatBytes(ListItem(B) DL, A) => #ConcatBytes(DL, A +Bytes B)

  rule <k> CONCAT A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> L => #ConcatBytes(L, .Bytes) ... </stack>
       <stacktypes> list _ bytes _ ; _ </stacktypes>
```

Size is relatively simple, except that we must remember to divide by two, since bytes length is measured in terms of number of bytes, not characters in the hex string.

```k
  rule <k> SIZE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B => lengthBytes(B) ... </stack>
```

The remaining operations are defined in terms of the same operations on strings, allowing for code reuse.

```k
  syntax OptionData ::= #SliceBytes(Bytes, Int, Int) [function]

  rule #SliceBytes(S, O, L) => Some substrBytes(S, O, O +Int L)
  requires O >=Int 0 andBool L >=Int 0 andBool O <Int lengthBytes(S) andBool (O +Int L) <=Int lengthBytes(S)

  rule #SliceBytes(S, O, L) => None [owise]

  rule <k> SLICE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> O:Int ~> L:Int ~> B:Bytes => #SliceBytes(B, O, L)  ... </stack>

  rule #DoCompare(B1:Bytes, B2:Bytes) => #DoCompare(Bytes2Int(B1, BE, Unsigned), Bytes2Int(B2, BE, Unsigned))
```

The cryptographic operations are simply stubbed for now.

```k
  //// Cryptographic primitives

  syntax String ::= #Blake2BKeyHash(String) [function] // TODO: Blake2B crypto hook.
  rule #Blake2BKeyHash(S) => S

  rule <k> HASH_KEY A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Key(S) => #KeyHash(#Blake2BKeyHash(S)) ... </stack>

  rule <k> BLAKE2B A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B:MBytes => #Blake2B(B) ... </stack>

  rule <k> SHA256 A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B:MBytes => #SHA256(B) ... </stack>

  rule <k> SHA512 A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> B:MBytes => #SHA512(B) ... </stack>

  syntax MBytes ::= #SignedMBytes(Key, Signature, MBytes)

/*  rule <k> CHECK_SIGNATURE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Key(K) ~> #Signature(S) ~> #SignedMBytes(#Key(K), #Signature(S), _) => true ... </stack>

  rule <k> CHECK_SIGNATURE A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Key(_) ~> #Signature(_) ~> _:MBytes => false ... </stack> [owise] // TODO: Bug - The haskell backend does not support distinguishing these rules.*/

  rule #DoCompare(#KeyHash(S1), #KeyHash(S2)) => #DoCompare(S1, S2)
```

Mutez operations need to check their results since Mutez is not an unlimited precision type.  This KItem checks and produces the appropriate error case if the value is invalid.

```k
  //// Operations on Mutez
  syntax KItem ::= #ValidateMutezAndPush(Mutez, Int, Int)

  syntax FailedStack ::= #FailureFromMutezValue(Mutez, Int, Int) [function]
  rule #FailureFromMutezValue(#Mutez(I), I1, I2) => ( MutezOverflow I1 I2 ) requires I >=Int #MutezOverflowLimit
  rule #FailureFromMutezValue(#Mutez(I), I1, I2) => ( MutezUnderflow I1 I2 ) requires I <Int 0


  rule <k> #ValidateMutezAndPush(#Mutez(I), _, _) => . ... </k>
       <stack> . => #Mutez(I) ... </stack>
       requires #IsLegalMutezValue(I)

  rule <k> #ValidateMutezAndPush(#Mutez(I), I1, I2) ~> Rk => Aborted("Mutez out of bounds", I, Rk, Rs) </k>
       <stack> Rs => #FailureFromMutezValue(#Mutez(I), I1, I2) </stack>
       requires notBool #IsLegalMutezValue(I)
```

Other than the mutez validation step, these arithmetic rules are essentially identical to those defined over integers.

```k
  rule <k> ADD A => #ValidateMutezAndPush(#Mutez(I1 +Int I2), I1, I2) ~> #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> #Mutez(I2) => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> SUB A => #ValidateMutezAndPush(#Mutez(I1 -Int I2), I1, I2) ~> #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> #Mutez(I2) => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> MUL A => #ValidateMutezAndPush(#Mutez(I1 *Int I2), I1, I2) ~> #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> I2 => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> MUL A => #ValidateMutezAndPush(#Mutez(I1 *Int I2), I1, I2) ~> #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> I1 ~> #Mutez(I2) => . ... </stack>

  rule <k> EDIV A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> #Mutez(0) => None ... </stack>

  rule <k> EDIV A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> 0 => None ... </stack>

  rule <k> EDIV A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> #Mutez(I2) => Some (Pair (I1 /Int I2) #Mutez(I1 %Int I2)) ... </stack>
       requires I2 >Int 0

  rule <k> EDIV A => #HandleAnnotations(A) ... </k>
       <stack> #Mutez(I1) ~> I2 => Some (Pair #Mutez(I1 /Int I2) #Mutez(I1 %Int I2)) </stack>
       requires I2 >Int 0

  rule #DoCompare(#Mutez(I1), #Mutez(I2)) => #DoCompare(I1, I2)
```

This rule simply clears the returncode if the k cell empties properly.

```k
  rule <k> . </k> <returncode> 1 => 0 </returncode>
endmodule
```
